6;The writers got carried away  directors  reached   studio sacrificed  integrity   productPaynebyname May Warning SpoilersIve just come  watching Endgame  I must say  I  disappointedI loved Civil War  I loved Infinity War When I came    films I knew immediately    great   I wanted  see   With Endgame Im  sureI respect    prepared  show  consequences   Thanos  done   killing    quickly         stone quest hadnt  already seen Thanos    IW  felt slow  lazy Worse still    felt  selfindulgent  attempting   clever  clever sakeLike  Back   Future II considered  clever  showing  events   first film   Marty flitting around behind  scenes  ensure    still happened I know  meant   fan pleasing   really felt like  gimmick  lacking  confidence Almost like   saying Hey guys  will make  smile If  want  make  smile concentrate  maintaining  quality   product rather  directly trying  make  like youBut  trouble  messing around  timelines  bouncing around    makes  audience start asking questions   film The linearity  wed seen  IW   imminent fast approaching threat  replaced  Endgame   lack  direction  characters   earlier versions    audience  seenIn IW   shown Thanos He  written   sympathetic   least  character    audience  understand He believed        made   rounded But  Endgame  version  dispatched quickly    supplied  aThanos  isnt  character  know   just  token bad guyThis Thanos hasnt made  sacrifice  Vormire  isnt  guy   empathise  Scarlet Witch      Vision He  suddenly become  token cut  evil bad guy  needs   defeated Hell  writers even manage  forget   time loop  saying   Thanos  learnt   doesnt want  wipe outanymore     ungrateful How   know   theThanos   just literally arrived   post wipeout Universe How    time  form  opinion   previous quest  acull isnt worthyIs   case   writers  terrified    created  bad guy  people related      fear  theyd written    hole Why go   effort  creating  character  IW  suddenly kill     beginning  Endgame just   dramatic punchFor   time travelling  stone gathering wasted time  create unimportant scenes  fundamentally undermine  films  came beforeIn  opinion     better    shown  remaining Avengers preparing    Avenging  maintained  single minded linearity  IW  battling towards  reaching  post click Thanos  somehow reversing  workThe  I think   film   plot holes  frustrations manifest  Thors drinking  man child antics might   initially funny  one begins  realise    deliberately    clip  wings Likewise  Hulk  primordial desire  smash  destroy   removed  think      become  embarrassing shadow   former selfThe thing   meant   amazing   MCU   world building  inconsistencies   appearing     many  Endgame   makes  question whether  two films  written    peopleIn IW Thanos   dangerous  credible threat     infinity stones He takes  half   Avengers Strange     Guardians  Titan  smashes    takes    half  Wakanda  smashes  Yet   Stormbreaker whose creation   seen  hard earned   motivated Thor    power  take  Thanos even     full complement  Infinity StonesYet  roll forward  Endgame    literally   good guys together  one place Cap   shield Tony fully powered  Scarlet Witch pssed  vengeful Capt Marvel  can seemingly  anything  Thor wielding  Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker  Thanos NOT  possession   gauntlet yet  cant defeat himIts like  fights  IW   amazing   good guys  taking   unbeatable foe yet    now seemingly defeatable   rules   writers establishedA good example      IW  Cap   last man standing  Scarlet Witch   grabs  gauntlet You see  look  admirationrespect  Thanos face  Cap  holding open  gauntlet   punches    ground yet now  scene seems pointlessThe writers  Endgame seem    driven  undo everything    IW All  tension   sacrifice   development  Thanos discarded  well I dont know  It makes  senseIW  two incredible scenes  used  choke   When Cap appears   train station  Avengers theme kicks   Falcon  Widow take   henchman   wonderfully choreographed scene In just  one scene  shows  coming   rescue  shows  intuitively  work together   showcases  heroismLikewise  Thor creates Stormbreaker  makes  entrance  Wakanda I felt    journey  Thor    Hes   contend  loss  defeat  humiliation     redemption Here   character   earned  game changing weapon    arrives  demands  face  character  everyone else  running away  I want  punch  airBut  Endgame  feels like     corrupted We cant  Thor  dominant lets break   make   fool We cant  Thanos  complicated  relatable lets make   cut  bad guy We cant  Hulk  rage fuelled  smashing stuff  lets make   sensitive  talking stuff  We cant  Cap  stoic  heroic lets   ridiculing one    iconic lines   silly gimmicky fight    commenting   butt We cant   powerful female character   invested  look sexy AND  able  take  Thanos lets give Scarlet Witch  small part  focus  attention   female character  hasnt earnt  admiration  desire  revengeTo  honest  rules  engagement   set  well  IW    Endgame Thanos massed  ranks   Avengers   ALL   good guys showed  I  almost expecting  camera  pull away   show  fight given     obviously going    easy win   good guysAnd    big fight scene   reek   DC always manage     just throw everything   end battle  bludgeon   CGI  pyrotechnics    arent really sure   going onIn  many fights  IW  knew   going   recognised  combatants  understood  stakes   identified  geography   scene In Endgame  got one big massive fight  everything  thrown   pot    just assumed   directors     happy    flashing lightsAnd I   say  considering  Steve  Tony fell   hard   Tonys criticism  Steve   unfair  I really  hoped    just  handshake  muttering   worries  heres  shield These guys wrote  directed Civil War  created  line  fell  hard  hence I  hoped  something deeper   touching   handshakeSteve wrote Tony  letter telling     needed  hed       Iron Man bias   creep     Tony   victim   ultimate heroBut I think  biggest problem    convenient time travelling undermines everything When  franchise starts retrofitting stuff like Furys eye    space cat   hard  consider  previous storiesHavingGamorra means    evolution   saw  go   GOTGandis wasted Having Cap marry Peggy means  pain   sacrifice  seeing   Winter Soldier    suffering  Alzheimers hell even  blossoming relationship  Sharon Carter  kinda irrelevant Having seen Thor  last step away   two weaker origin films   entertainment  Ragnarok   redemption  IW leaves us now   bumbling buffoonWe know   makes Captain America      serum  makes   super soldier That   transformed   weakling   superhuman Sam Wilson    super soldier   didnt take

shown  can recognise  Sam Wilson    thatIm sorry  say   Russos  dropped  ball Themselves   writers  succumbed   success   desire   engineers  political correctness  social change I thought Endgame    high soaring end  thisyear run  impressive movie entertainment    end  writers got carried away  directors  reached   studio sacrificed  integrity   product   chance  educate us  A real shame   wasted
